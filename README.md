# ConciseReview

## Description
The Concise Review project serves as a resource for students to further their abilities in Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra. The project is not only for students, but also for the intellectually curious. I hope that people can reference this project as a way to stay on top of their advanced math classes or add new topics to their 
mathematical repertoire. 

## Future
I plan to add sections for Applied Probability, Applied Statistics, and Ordinary Differential Equations in June 2022.
